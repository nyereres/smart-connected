# Predictive Maintenance – Vibration Anomaly Detection (Smart Sensor)

A proof-of-concept Industrial IoT project that detects abnormal vibration patterns in rotating machines using high-frequency acceleration data, FFT-based spectral analysis, and anomaly detection logic (distance-based or autoencoder). When an anomaly is detected, the system triggers a visual alarm and sends status data wirelessly to a dashboard.

Built as part of the Smart Connected Devices / Smart Manufacturing project track.

## 📌 Project Goal

Design and implement a smart vibration sensor system that:

- Samples Z-axis vibration data at ≥ 1 kHz
- Converts time-domain signals to frequency spectrum using FFT
- Learns a baseline “normal” vibration signature
- Detects abnormal patterns using:
  - Euclidean distance **or**
  - Autoencoder reconstruction error
- Triggers an LED or software flag on anomaly detection
- Sends data wirelessly to a dashboard
- Stores measurement data for later analysis

## 🧠 Detection Methods

### Distance-Based
Compares live spectrum to baseline spectrum using Euclidean distance.  
Triggers anomaly if distance exceeds threshold.

### Autoencoder-Based (Optional)
Model learns normal spectrum patterns and flags anomalies based on reconstruction error.
